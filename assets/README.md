# Module 2 Challenge

## My Portfolio

My portfolio is an accessible site to view my work, contact me, and learn about me.

The motivation behind this project was to create an acessible site for anyone to visit and check out my work. As class goes on, I will be adding my projects to this page for classmates and future employers to view. This site makes it easy to access my work. My portfolio also has a responsive layout so anyone can view it on a phone. 

This challenge improved my HTML and CSS skills. I will continue to make improvements to my portfolio, so visit frequently! 

## Installation

Used git clone to connect my repo to my local device. 

## Usage

Use this site to learn more about me, access my projects through out my Bootcamp course, and to contact me. This page can also be used to access my github and linkedin profiles.
